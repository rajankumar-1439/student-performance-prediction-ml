<h2>Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning</h2>

🧾Summary :-

✅ Predicts student academic performance based on demographic, academic, and behavioral features using supervised machine learning models.

👉Overview :-
This project uses historical student data to analyze patterns and predict performance outcomes, enabling data-driven academic support and intervention.✅

This is a basic but essential ML classification/regression problem.✅

❓ Problem Statement

✅Given student-related features such as:

Study time

Previous scores

Attendance


👉 Predict the student’s final academic performance (score/category).



📊 Dataset

👉 Student Performance Dataset :- <a href="https://github.com/rajankumar-1439/student-performance-prediction-ml/blob/main/student_habits_performance.csv">Student_habits_Dataset</a>

Dataset Features:

✅student_ID

✅Gender

✅Parental education level

✅Study hours

✅Test scores

✅Attendance




🛠️ Tools & Technologies

✅Python, ✅NumPy, ✅Pandas, ✅Matplotlib / Seaborn, ✅Scikit-learn, ✅Jupyter Notebook



⚙️ Methods & Workflow

🔁 Step-by-Step Approach:

1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

2️⃣ Data Cleaning 

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis 

4️⃣ Feature Selection & Encoding

5️⃣ Train-Test Split

6️⃣ Model Training (Regression / Classification)

7️⃣ Model Evaluation

8️⃣ Result Interpretation


🌐 Key Insights

✅Study time has a direct impact on performance

✅Past academic scores are strong predictors

✅Certain demographic factors influence outcomes

✅Data quality affects prediction more than model choice


🖥️ Model / Output



✅Trained ML model predicts student performance

✅Outputs numerical score or performance category

✅Evaluation metrics include:

✅Accuracy / R² Score

✅Mean Squared Error (if regression)
